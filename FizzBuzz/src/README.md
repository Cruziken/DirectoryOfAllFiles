Exercise 1

Print "Hello World!" Associated file: Excercise1.java

Exercise 2

Print "Hello World!" and get user input from Command Line. Associated file: Exercise2.java

Exercise 3

Print "Hello World!", get user input of filename, read the file, and print the contents. Associated file: Exercise3.java

Exercise 4

Print "Hello World!", get user input of filename, read the file, print the content, and copy the contents to another file. Associated file: Exercise4.java

Exercise 5

Basically Exercise 4 but with classes (introduces OO concepts). Associated files: Excersise5.java, PromptnPrint.java, Screamers.java, Copiers.java, Interfacer.java

Exercise 6 (FizzBuzz with OO concepts)

Step 1: Read off an INI file with the following format max_int = //In this case key = 100 lower_divisor = //In this case key = 3 upper_divisor = //In this case key = 5 lower_divisor_label = //In this case key = fizz upper_divisor_label = // In this case key = buzz

Step 2: Print the integers 1-max_int. If the integer is divisible by lower_divisor, print lower_divisor_label instead of the integer. If the integer is divisible by upper_divisor, print upper_divisor_label instead. If it is divisible by both lower_divisor and upper_divisor, print lower_divisor_label+upper_divisor_label.

Step 3: In addition to printing the output, store it in a log file named log_.text
